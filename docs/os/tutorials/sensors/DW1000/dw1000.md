## DW1000

### Introduction

  The DW1000 is a fully integrated low power, single chip CMOS radio transceiver IC compliant with the IEEE 802.15.4-2011 ultra-wideband (UWB) standard.

* It facilitates proximity detection to an accuracy of +/- 10 cm using two-way ranging time-of-flight (TOF)
measurements
* It facilitates real time location of assets in to an accuracy of +/- 10 cm using either two-way ranging (TOF)
measurements or one-way time difference of arrival (TDOA) Time Difference of Arrival schemes
* It spans 6 RF bands from 3.5 GHz to 6.5 GHz
* It supports data rates of 110 kbps, 850 kbps and 6.8 Mbps
* Its high data rates allow it to keep on-air time short and thereby save power and extend battery lifetimes
* Its ability to deal with severe multipath environments makes it ideal for highly reflective RF
environments

### Features

DW1000 has some other features which includes following:

* External Synchronisation
* External Power Amplification
* Using the on-chip OTP memory
* Measuring IC temperature and voltage
