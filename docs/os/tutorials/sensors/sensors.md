## Sensor Tutorials Overview

This set of sensor tutorials allows you to explore the Mynewt Sensor Framework features and learn how to develop sensor-enabled Mynewt applications.

The Mynewt Sensor framework supports:

* Onboard and off-board sensors.
* Retrieving sensor data and controlling sensor devices via the Mynewt OS Shell.
* Retrieving sensor data over the OIC protocol and BLE transport.

### Available Tutorials

The tutorials are:

* [Enabling an Off-Board Sensor in an Existing Application](/os/tutorials/sensors/sensor_nrf52_bno055.md) -  This is an introductory tutorial that shows you to how to quickly bring up a sensor enabled application that retrieves data from a sensor device. We recommend that you work through this tutorial before trying one of the other tutorials.

* [Changing the Default Configuration for a Sensor](/os/tutorials/sensors/sensor_offboard_config.md) -  This tutorial shows you how to change the default configuration values for a sensor. 

* [Developing an Application for an Onboard Sensor](/os/tutorials/sensors/sensor_thingy_lis2dh12_onb.md) -  This tutorial shows you how to develop a simple application for a device with an onboard sensor.

* [Enabling OIC Sensor Data Monitoring in an Existing Application](/os/tutorials/sensors/sensor_oic_overview.md) - This tutorial shows you how to enable support for sensor data monitoring via OIC in an existing application.

* [Provided READMEs of DW1000 Applications](/os/tutorials/sensors/dw1000.md) - This tutorial shows you how to build and run the existing apps of DW1000.


### Mynewt Smart Device Controller OIC App

We use the `Mynewt Sensor Monitor` App on iOS or Android to retrieve and display sensor data from the Mynewt OS OIC sensor applications described in the OIC Sensor Data Monitoring tutorials. You can download the app from either the Apple Store or Google Play Store. 

**Note:** At the time of writing this tutorial, the iOS app was still in the queue waiting to be placed in the App Store. You can build the iOS app from source as indicated below.

If you would like to contribute or modify the Mynewt Smart Device Controller App, see the [Android Sensor source](https://github.com/runtimeco/android_sensor) and [iOS Sensor source](https://github.com/runtimeco/iOS_oic) on github.

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you meet the following prerequisites before continuing with one of the tutorials. 

* Have Internet connectivity to fetch remote Mynewt components.
* Have a computer to build a Mynewt application and connect to the board over USB.
* Have a Micro-USB cable to connect the board and the computer.
* Install the newt tool and toolchains (See [Basic Setup](/os/get_started/get_started.md)).
* Read the Mynewt OS [Concepts](/os/get_started/vocabulary.md) section. 
* Create a project space (directory structure) and populate it with the core code repository (apache-mynewt-core) explained in [Creating Your First Project](/os/get_started/project_create).
* Work through one of the [Blinky Tutorials](/os/tutorials/blinky.md).
